# React Remember, or Follow your Sign!

## How it works…

Users can play a simple matching game. User attempts to guess a card they have yet to chose. The top Score is 12 and the cards are shuffled before each choice.

Choosing a card that has already been chosen ends the game.

## Technology Used…

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Hey look at that!

## Difficulties

The  hurdle was shuffling the display of the cards. I was able to do it, but it threw other things off. I ended up performing shuffle on the mapped array of Sign Components.
